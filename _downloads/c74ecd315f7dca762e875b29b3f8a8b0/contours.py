"""
Countour plots
=========================
Generating contour plots directly from data.
"""

# %%
# Support for contour plots directly from a table of precomputed data is
# relatively limited in `pgfplots`. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
# uses `contourpy` to generate contours out of a matrix of `z`-values.
# Using the same underlying engine, `pykz` can bring this same type of plots
# directly to pgfplots.

# %%
# We import the usual libraries.
import numpy as np
import pykz

# %%
# Let's generate some data. We do this in exactly the same way as you would using
# Matplotlib.

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)
y = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)


def f(x, y):
    return np.sin(2 * np.pi * x) * np.cos(2 * np.pi * y)


X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = f(X, Y)

# %%
# By default, `pykz` picks the contour levels to draw by
# dividing the range of `z`-values into equally spaced bins.

contours = pykz.contour(X, Y, Z)
pykz.xlabel("$x$")
pykz.ylabel("$y$")

# Export your tex code as a standalone file
pykz.save("contour_plot.tex", standalone=True)
# Build the pdf
pykz.io.export_pdf_from_file("contour_plot.tex")

# %%
# Of course you can also customize the plot in all kinds of ways.
# For instance, let us change the colormap and visualize the z-values
# with a colorbar. Also, let us set the x and y limits to be tight.

pykz.colorbar()
pykz.gca().set_option("colormap name", "viridis")
pykz.gca().enlarge_limits(0)

# Export your tex code as a standalone file
pykz.save("contour_plot_fancy.tex", standalone=True)
# Optionally, build the pdf
pykz.io.export_pdf_from_file("contour_plot_fancy.tex")


# %%
# Similarly, we can create filled contours. Let's get rid of the existing contour,
# and replace it with a filled contour. Alternatively, we could of course just create
# a new figure as well.
# This time, let's also specify the contour levels we want to show,
#
for contour in contours:
    pykz.gca().remove(contour)

levels = np.linspace(-1, 1, 20)
contourfs = pykz.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=levels)

# Export your tex code as a standalone file
pykz.save("contour_plot_filled.tex", standalone=True)
# Optionally, build the pdf
pykz.io.export_pdf_from_file("contour_plot_filled.tex")

# %%
# Or, we could go even further in customizing the appearance of the end result,
# using options that get passed to the generated `pgfplots` `addplot` command.
# Essentially any option that is recognized by `pgfplots` can be directly added here.
#
for contour in contourfs:
    pykz.gca().remove(contour)

levels = np.linspace(-1, 1, 20)
contourfs = pykz.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=levels, draw=True, fill_opacity=0.6)

# Export your tex code as a standalone file
pykz.save("contour_plot_filled_custom.tex", standalone=True)
# Optionally, build the pdf
path_png = pykz.io.export_png_from_file("contour_plot_filled_custom.tex")
print(path_png)
