Minimal working example
=========================
Minimal working example of `pykz`, plotting a simple sine function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-21

.. code-block:: Python

    import numpy as np
    import pykz

    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = np.sin(x)

    pykz.plot(x, y)

    # Export your tex code as a standalone file
    pykz.save("basic_inline.tex", standalone=True)
    # You could also directly build the pdf
    pykz.io.export_pdf_from_file("basic_inline.tex")

Alternatively, output it to png

.. code-block:: python

  pykz.io.export_png_from_file("basic_inline.tex")

Or, save the Tikz code to a temporary file, compile it, and open the pdf in the default viewer.
This would be the equivalent to ``plt.show()``

.. code-block:: python

  pykz.preview()
